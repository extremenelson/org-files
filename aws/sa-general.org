**** Notes section at start?
**** In Agenda use cost analysis
**** ""Diagram is in no way complete"" - leads to question of what were the existing conversations about?
**** AIX Self service web site - represented in final design?
**** I would like to circle back. If that works for you.... - hedge terms are not confidence inspiring
**** Blown this up - might be better as dive into deeper detail. More in line with AWS messaging.
**** Pause more often. Breathe.
**** Ask if there are any questions for each point. Make the session interactive.
**** Turn off all other notifications
**** Ask followup if third party logging is happening on premises or in cloud?
**** Consider putting challenges up front - before even looking at existing architecture
**** The proposed arhcitecture is serverless. - qualify whcih architecture
**** As we discussed at our first meeting - refer back to the existing meeting to refresh concepts
**** Customers might not be known for developing applications.
**** Goal is to help customer achieve their business outcomes
**** Good job with security is job zero
**** Good job with usecase - including it in the presentation
**** Shared responsibilty model - AWS secures the cloud - customer secures in the cloud
**** Don't hedge - address your concerns to the best of my abilities
**** Ask customer which they would prefer and then explain more detail about that choice
**** Let me make a note of this and I will get those answers for you
**** CloudTrail can be forwarded to CloudWatch
**** CloudWatch retention - max retention period
***** retention is 15 months max
***** 60seconds - 3 hours
***** 1min - 15 days
***** 5min - 63 days
***** 1hour - 15 months
**** Error rate for textract?
***** question was asked. Why question if I am interested?
***** Confidence score?
**** When I am doing the POC?
***** Clarify the working model
***** phased approach
**** Might have skipped the phase 2
***** Go straight to the pricing and then ask if customer would like to see phase 2 during question time
**** Time management - save 5 min for questions at the end
**** Call cost analysis just that
***** safe to call it cost estimation
**** Break out phase 1 and phase 2 costs and include overall cost

**** VP of technology

**** CISO
*** Presentation Notes
**** I'm here to talk about
**** So, ah *
**** ummmm
**** Security is number 1 priority - actually job 0
**** Focus on business outcome not application(s)
**** Electricity analogy, use we don't build generating plants, flip a switch
**** Question that always comes to mind? Most customers only want to solve their problems.
***** Agility
***** Cost Savings
****** question on value of opex vs capex
******* Answered with RI
***** Elasticity - Explain what overcapacity is before
***** Innovate Faster
****** Andy Jassey - undiferentiated heavy lifting
***** Global - good lead into future slide
***** Breadth and depth
****** 175+ - still correct
***** I would want to.... Don't make it about you
***** Industry leaders slide - use eyechart analogy
***** Gregraphical presence vs global presence
***** Too much time on industry leaders
***** Wait till security slide to address security concerns. Otherwise you use up too much time.
***** I will be moving on to the next slide
**** Global presence
***** Validate correctness of slide
***** Data centers - low latency
***** Explain details - distance, latency, fault line, flood plain etc
***** LAtency is always an issue with cross region - can't beat the speed of light
***** Azure more regions? - Azure region is not POP it is closer to a AZ
**** Broad and deep
***** Refer to chart as an eyechart - Don't worry about memorizing all of these.... Put customer at ease
***** Talk About The layers - core is base that everything else is built on
***** Security - Reinforce job 0 at AWS
***** TAM is enterprise support - talk about the AWS team
**** Shared responsibility
***** Refer to company by name to make it more personal
***** Capital One is touchy topic. Avoid using it if you can.
***** On prem vs on premises
**** Compliance controls
***** Data center physical access?
****** Attestations
****** Good point to stress the separation of duties as well
**** Ecosystem
***** Dont read the slide - Augment the slide
***** Licensing - check with your vendor
**** Cloud journey
***** More than two categories - these are quite often the journeys that our customers have taken when migrating to the cloud
***** Project - POC Show value quickly

*** nat
**** CICD?
*** ais
**** continuusly deploying in pipeline
**** deployment chunks are broken down to smaller pieces
**** Automatically moved to staging
**** Automatically tested and results are reported back
**** Can be completed in days instead of weeks
**** Can potentially catch issues earlier in the cycle
**** Jenkins, bitbucket, puppet chef
*** nat
**** VCS

**** how rac works?
*** ais
**** vip points to multiple nodes
